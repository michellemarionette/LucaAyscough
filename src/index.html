                        <h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
                        <p>
                            I was born in Edinburgh and moved to Italy when I was 5. Ever since I have been going back and forth
                            between the two countries. I attended school in Sicily and moved to Bologna to study music and
                            cinema in Bologna. I have a keen interest in computers and art. I first started learning about
                            computers when I was 10 and quickly started designing and developing websites. My interesest
                            in art is mostly rooted in my love for music which started when I was 11 when I started playing guitar.
                            Since then I have played music with hundreds of people and been in half a dozen bands. 
                            I am an avid learner and always have the urge to expand my knowledge and skills.
                        </p>

                            with an idea for a song and my job is to facilitate the songwriting process and the definition
                            of a sound pallete. Then I will produce and engineer the song.
