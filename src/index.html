                                    I was born in Edinburgh in 1998 and moved to Sicily when I was five. With family in both countries, I travel regularly between the two and am fluent in English and Italian. My schooling was in Sicily and in 2017 I moved to Bologna to study music and cinema. I became interested in computers from the age of ten and quickly developed the skills to design and build websites. My main passion is music, learning to play guitar when I was eleven. Now a composer/producer, I have produced music for my fellow musicians and for commercial projects as well as my own creative endeavours for years. I have worked alongside a wide spectrum of people and deeply believe in the power of collaboration. I am a compulsive learner, always looking to expand my skills and knowledge. I am currently based in Edinburgh but I will soon be moving to London.

                        Gravity is an innovative audio plugin which I started developing at the start of 2021.
                        It is an attempt to build the first commercially viable unconditional generator of audio samples through a Generative Adversarial Network deep learning architecture.
                        The underlying core technology is based on the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.04958.pdf" target="_blank">StyleGAN series of deep learning algorithms</a>, adapted to the audio domain.<br>
                        It is capable of unconditionally generating random audio samples of a few seconds and then interpolating between them to create new ones.
                        The vision is to allow for the intricate manipulation of generated samples by controlling the mixture of the various coarse and fine-grained components of which they are made.<br>
                        Links to download the alpha version of the app can be found in the <a href="#" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a>.
