                        I have been studying and playing music most of my life and I am fascinated by technology and its relationship to music and sound.
                        I have worked in a large variety of creative and technical contexts allowing me to develop my skills as an engineer, sound designer and producer.
                        I am also the creator of the Gravity audio plugin, an innovative app which allows users to generate sounds in an unprecedented way.

                                    I was born in Edinburgh and moved to Italy when I was 5. Ever since I have been going back and forth
                                    between the two countries. I attended school in Sicily and moved to Bologna to study music and
                                    cinema in Bologna. I have a keen interest in computers and art. I first started learning about
                                    computers when I was 10 and quickly started designing and developing websites. My interesest
                                    in art is mostly rooted in my love for music which started when I was 11 when I started playing guitar.
                                    Since then I have played music with hundreds of people and been in half a dozen bands. 
                                    I am an avid learner and always have the urge to expand my knowledge and skills.

                        Gravity is an innovative audio plugin which I started developing at the start of 2021.
                        It is an attempt to build the first commercially viable unconditional generator of audio samples through a Generative Adversarial Network deep learning architecture.
                        The underlying core technology is based on the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.04958.pdf" target="_blank">StyleGAN series of deep learning algorithms</a>, adapted to the audio domain.
                        It is capable of unconditionally generating random audio samples of a few seconds and then interpolating between them to create new ones.
                        The vision is to allow for the intricate manipulation of generated samples by controlling the mixture of the various coarse and fine-grained components of which they are made.
