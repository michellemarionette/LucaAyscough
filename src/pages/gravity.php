            Gravity is an innovative audio plugin which I started developing at the start of 2021.
            It is an attempt to build the first commercially viable unconditional generator of audio samples through a Generative Adversarial Network deep learning architecture.
            The underlying core technology is based on the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.04958.pdf" target="_blank">StyleGAN series of deep learning algorithms</a>, adapted to the audio domain.<br>
            It is capable of unconditionally generating random audio samples of a few seconds and then interpolating between them to create new ones.
            The vision is to allow for the intricate manipulation of generated samples by controlling the mixture of the various coarse and fine-grained components of which they are made.<br>
            Links to download the alpha version of the app will be available soon.
