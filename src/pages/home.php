        <h3>ABOUT</h3><br>
        <p>
            I have been studying and playing music most of my life and I am fascinated by technology and its relationship to music and sound. I specialize in audio production and sound design and have worked in a large variety of creative and technical contexts allowing me to develop my skills as an engineer, sound designer and producer. I am also the creator of Gravity, an audio plugin which allows users to generate sounds in an unprecedented way.

                <h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
                <div class="job">
                    <p>
                        I was born in Edinburgh in 1998 and moved to Sicily when I was five. With family in both countries, I travel regularly between the two and am fluent in English and Italian. My schooling was in Sicily and in 2017 I moved to Bologna to study music and cinema. I became interested in computers from the age of ten and quickly developed the skills to design and build websites. My main passion is music, learning to play guitar when I was eleven. Now a composer/producer, I have produced music for my fellow musicians and for commercial projects as well as my own creative endeavours for years. I have worked alongside a wide spectrum of people and deeply believe in the power of collaboration. I am a compulsive learner, always looking to expand my skills and knowledge. I am currently based in Edinburgh but I will soon be moving to London.
