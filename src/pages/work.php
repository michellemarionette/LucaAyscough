            Following are a few examples of advertising jobs for which I was hired to write and produce musical scores.
            I have included a couple of videos that showcase the contexts the music was used in.
            Below you will find a playlist with a larger list of examples.
            The first example titled "GypsyJ" is a collaboration between me and a friend I hired to help with the writing process and the performance of the guitar parts.
